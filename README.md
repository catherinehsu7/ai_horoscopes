# ai_horoscopes
This project was an exploration of GPT-Neo, a text generation AI program that scrapes text information from the internet and auto-completes user input.
I gave the program prompts with horoscopes and different categories to get potential horoscope responses (1200 possible outcomes), and used HTML and CSS to design the front-end user interface for a simple one-page site.
